## What is the purpose of this tool?

There are already lots of tools for build optimization, mainly in the form of spreadsheets or slugbot. However, I could not find a way to compare whole builds together. Usually you get tools for optimal infusion, optimal stats but always for one weapon or weapon class. There isn't to my knowledge a way to see the damage values of a **whole inventory** across **multiple builds**. So I made one.

## Use case examples

- How much more damage do I get with 69 STR compared to 54 STR on all these weapons?
- Is Cold -> Lightning better than Cold -> Magic for this inventory?
- Fire + Flaming Strike buff or Heavy + Lightning Grease?
- How broken is Sacred Blade?
- What is the best build for BKH and Dismounter between these three?

## So what does it actually do?

You input a list of **weapons** of your choice and as many **builds** and **infusions** as you like and you get a table with estimated damage that is widely customizable. You can display counter damage, comparisons with the best infusion etc... You can also export raw data as a CSV file or download the table as a PNG image (WIP) to get a cleaner result than screenshots.

## Ok, how do I use it?

Input your weapons, builds and ennemy stats in **🛠️ Parameters**. Then go to **🔬 Build Comparator** to see the table and change what information you want to display. There are already some default weapons and builds so you can go straight to **🔬 Build Comparator** to see what the table looks like.

## I would like to give some feedback.

Whether it is for functionnality request, default values suggestions or anything else really, feel free to message  **.smaxy.** on Discord.
