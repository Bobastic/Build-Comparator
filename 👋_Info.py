There are already lots of tools for build optimization, mainly in the form of spreadsheets or slugbot.
However, I could not find a way to compare whole builds together.
Usually you get tools for optimal infusion, optimal stats but always for one weapon or weapon class.
There isn't to my knowledge a way to see the damage values of a <strong>whole inventory</strong> across <strong>multiple builds</strong>. So I made one.
I also added other functionalities like an infusion optimizer or a stat allocator.

- What is the best build for BKH and Dismounter between these three?
- Best infusion and stat spread for Shamshir?

Input a list of <strong>weapons</strong> of your choice and as many <strong>builds</strong> and <strong>infusions</strong> as you like and you get a table with estimated damage that is widely customizable.
You can display counter damage, comparisons with the best infusion etc...
You can also export raw data as a CSV file or download the table as a HTML file.
There are already some default weapons and builds so you can go straight to any page to see what this tool can do.

Pick a weapon and you'll have estimated damage for each infusion with the specified stat spread.
On the right you will find the optimal stat spread for the infusion of your choice as well as the damage difference with your current stat spread.
