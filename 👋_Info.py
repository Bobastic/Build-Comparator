There are already lots of tools for build optimization, mainly in the form of spreadsheets or slugbot.
However, I could not find a way to compare whole builds together.
Usually you get tools for optimal infusion, optimal stats but always for one weapon or weapon class.
There isn't to my knowledge a way to see the damage values of a <strong>whole inventory</strong> across <strong>multiple builds</strong>. So I made one.

- How much more damage do I get with 69 STR compared to 54 STR on all these weapons?

- What is the best build for BKH and Dismounter between these three?

You input a list of <strong>weapons</strong> of your choice and as many <strong>builds</strong> and <strong>infusions</strong> as you like and you get a table with estimated damage that is widely customizable.
You can display counter damage, comparisons with the best infusion etc...
You can also export raw data as a CSV file or download the table as a HTML file.

Input your weapons, builds, infusions and enemy stats in <strong>üõ†Ô∏è Parameters</strong>.
Then go to <strong>üî¨ Build Comparator</strong> to show the table and change what information you want to display.
There are already some default weapons and builds so you can go straight to <strong>üî¨ Build Comparator</strong> to see what the table looks like.
